# word2vec

word2vec is a shallow, two-layer neural network that accepts a text corpus as an input, and it returns a set of vectors (aka embeddings); each vector is a numeric 
representation of a given word.

"You shall know a word by the company it keeps." In other words you know the word by the context around it.
