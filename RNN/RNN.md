# Neural Network

Pattern matching through the connection of many very simple functions to create one very powerful function, very loosely based on connected neurons in the brain.

# Recurrent Neural Network

Pattern matching through the connection of many very simple functions to create one very powerful function; this function has an understanding of the data's sequential
nature (using feedback loops that form a sense of memory).
